# MILET:MULTIMODAL INTEGRATION AND LINEAR ENHANCED TRANSFORMER FOR ELECTRICITY PRICE FORECASTING

This is the official repo for Multimodal Integration and Linear Enhanced Transformer（MILET）for electricity price forecasting.

## Getting Started

1. Install Python >= 3.6, and install the dependencies by:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Generate the VMD-SE-"DATA".csv dataset

1. Please get the five areas from the open source python library data sets from
   https://github.com/jeslago/epftoolbox
   
2. Store the data set in the VMD-SE folder. Run the main file in the VMD-SE part to generate the VMD-SE data set and add it to the data folder in the upper level. If no, create it.

## Run MILET

1. Run the "run.py" file after completing the above steps to get the results of MILET.

## Other models

Thanks to the previous integration of Transformer models in time series forecasting, this model is based on the integration package, which also contains Transformer models with the best performance in recent years.
